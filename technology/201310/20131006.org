** job queue
   Definition: Job queue: A series of tasks automatically executed,
   one after the other, by the computer. In mainframe data processing
   during the 1950s and 1960s, the job queue was literallly a queue,
   or line of people waiting to have their programs run. With
   interactive, multi-user computing and personal computing, you
   usually don't need to line up to get your work done (although jobs
   can still back up at a busy printer). The term is still used in
   WordPerfect, for example, where you can assign a job number to
   several files you want to print, and the program prints the files
   in the order you assign.
